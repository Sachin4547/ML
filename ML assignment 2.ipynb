    "\n",
    "Overfitting\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise and outliers. This results in a model that performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor Generalization: The model fails to generalize to new data, leading to high variance.\n",
    "Increased Complexity: The model becomes overly complex, capturing noise as if it were a true pattern.\n",
    "Low Predictive Power: The predictive power of the model on new data is reduced.\n",
    "Mitigation Strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model performs well on different subsets of the data.\n",
    "Simpler Models: Opt for simpler models with fewer parameters that are less likely to overfit.\n",

    "Regularization:\n",
